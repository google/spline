This project is a sample application that demonstrates Android's data binding library in the context
of a vector drawing application. The app is designed for tablet devices and won't layout properly on
smaller devices. It is intended to demonstrate real-world challenges but should not be considered
a definitive recommendation on how to structure an application with data binding.
